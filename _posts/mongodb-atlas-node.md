title: Learn how to set up a database in MongoDB Atlas and connect to it using Node.js, with examples
---

In this blog, you will learn how to set a new MongoDB Atlas "NoSQL" database, connect to it through Node.js and add and get data. Here's what we will do:
- Create and configure a new MongoDB Atlas account
- Use Node.js to connect to our database, add a new document and get documents

I have set up a nicely organized Node.js shell program you can have.

As usual, you can find a fully working project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DaveStaudenmaier/mongodb-atlas-node)

Node.js version 12.18.3

## Overview

In this blog we will
## What is MongoDB Atlas?

MongoDB is a document-oriented, "NoSQL"

MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.  [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is a cloud-hosted MongoDB service where you can deploy, operate and scale MongoDB database starting with a free-tier.

## Create an Account in MongoDB Atlas

Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and click the *Start Free* button.

Register a new Account.

MongoDB Atlas offers many options for your application.   For our purposes, we will use the Free Tier, which is always a good idea to get started.

Next, it will ask you where you want to host the cluster.  I chose AWS.  Click the *Create Cluster* button.

It will take a few minutes to set up your account.   Note that in the lower left, it will walk you through the steps we are about to go through.

## Set up a Database User

When your cluster is created, click on the *Database Access* button and then click the *Add Database User* button to create a database user.

For the free-tier, we can set up a password.  I called the user 'Admin' and used an *Autogenerated Secure Password*.  Be sure to copy the password and save it. You will need it later when accessing from Node.js and then press the *Update User* button.  It may take a few minutes to set up your database user access. Please note that this account in this blog was deleted after I created this blog so my credentials no longer work.

## Set up Network Access

Click on the *Network Access* button and then click the *Add IP Address* button.

Next, you can whitelist a specific IP address or you can allow access from anywhere.  We will allow access form anywhere by clicking the *Allow Access From Anywhere* button and then clicking the *Confirm* button.   It may take a few minutes to set up your network access.

## Load Sample Data

This optional step will load some sample data that you can use to try out MongoDB Atlas and learn how to configure schemas.  If you would like to do this, click the elipsis next to the *Collections* button and select *Load Sample Dataset*.

It will take a few minutes to load the data and then you will see several different databases with dataasets like this.

## Connecting to the Cluster

The last step is to get the connection information we will need to access our cluster.
