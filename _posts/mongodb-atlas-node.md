title: Learn how to set up a database in MongoDB Atlas and connect to it using Node.js, with examples
---

In this blog, you will learn how to set a new MongoDB Atlas "NoSQL" database, connect to it through Node.js and add and get data. Here's what we will do:
- Create and configure a new MongoDB Atlas account
- Use Node.js to connect to our database, add a new document and get documents

I have set up a nicely organized Node.js shell program you can have.

As usual, you can find a fully working project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DaveStaudenmaier/mongodb-atlas-node)

Node.js version 12.18.3

## Overview

In this blog we will
## What is MongoDB Atlas?

MongoDB is a document-oriented, "NoSQL"

MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.  [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is a cloud-hosted MongoDB service where you can deploy, operate and scale MongoDB database starting with a free-tier.

## Create an Account in MongoDB Atlas

Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and click the *Start Free* button.

Register a new Account.

MongoDB Atlas offers many options for your application.   For our purposes, we will use the Free Tier, which is always a good idea to get started.

It will take a few minutes to set up your account.   Note that in the lower left, it will walk you through the steps we are about to go through.

## Set up a Database User

When your cluster is created, click on the *Database Access* button and then click the *Add Database User* button to create a database user.

For the free-tier, we can set up a password.  I called the user 'Admin' and used an *Autogenerated Secure Password*.  Be sure to copy the password and save it. You will need it later when accessing from Node.js and then press the *Update User* button.  Please note that this account in this blog was deleted after I created this blog so my credentials no longer work.

## Set up Network Access

Click on the *Network Access* button and then click the *Add IP Address* button.

Next, you can whitelist a specific IP address or you can allow access from anywhere.  We will allow access form anywhere by clicking the *Allow Access From Anywhere* button and then clicking the *Confirm* button.
