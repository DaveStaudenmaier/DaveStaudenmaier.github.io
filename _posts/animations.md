title: Practical, real-world animation examples with Angular
---

In this blog, I will who show some examples of practical, real-world animations using Angular, and will explain how they work.   Here are the animations we will cover: 
- A slide-down animation exposing an Add Post component's template
- A fade in for the new post applied
- A thumbnail photo that will expand smoothly to full-size when clicked and shrink back down when clicked again
- An animation that will draw attention to an element
- Two variations of animation when adding to a dynamic list.  One will fade in.  The other will slide in from the left. 
- Fade animation when changing routes, configured in one place

As usual, you can find a fully working project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DaveStaudenmaier/animations).

Angular Version: 9.1.0
