Angular Version: 9

You can find the complete code on my GitHub at [https://github.com/DaveStaudenmaier/AngularPWANavigationShell](https://github.com/DaveStaudenmaier/AngularPWANavigationShell).

Let's create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.   On your command line create a new project like this:

**ng new pwa-nav**
