title: How to intercept outgoing requests and incoming responses in Angular
---

In this blog, we will add an http-interceptor service to an Angular project and use it to simplify coding of outgoing requests and to detect a 504 timeout response from the server and retry the request automatically.

As usual, you can find a fully working project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DaveStaudenmaier/)

Angular Version: 9
