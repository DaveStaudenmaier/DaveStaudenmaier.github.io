title: Use ng-content (content projection), ng-template, ngTemplateOutlet and ng-container for a reusable component in a real-world use case with nice example code
---

In this blog, I will define a use case where it makes sense to employ content projection using ng-content as well as ng-template with ngTemplateOutlet and ng-container.   I will explain what these directives are and why we are using them.  

As usual, you can find a fully working project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DaveStaudenmaier/content-projection)

Angular Version: 9.1

## Our requirements (use case)

We have been given these requirements to create a reusable card component that will assure a consistent look-and-feel and branding for cards used throughout the application:
- Card must use our logo icon

- Card must have the title
## What is content projection and how can it help with our requirements?

## What is ng-template and ng-templateOutlet and why are they useful for our use case?

## What is ng-container and how can that help us?
