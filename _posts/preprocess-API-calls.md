title: In Angular, use BehaviorSubject to pre-process long-running API calls
---

In this blog, I will go over how you can get API data in advance so that when the user gets to the page that needs the data, it will be there.
This is useful when you have a potentially long-running API call and do not want to start the retrieval when the user arrives at the page
because they will have to wait.  Getting the data in advance and publishing via a BehaviorSubject will make the user experience more pleasant.

As usual, you can find a fully working project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DaveStaudenmaier/preprocess-API-calls)

Angular Version: 10.0.1
