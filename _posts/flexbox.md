title: Flexbox positioning, a web page where you can see how it works live
---

This week's blog will be a little different.  I wrote a simple web page that can help you learn the positioning aspects of flexbox by clicking options, seeing the results and the CSS involved.  I won't be sharing any code on GitHub or Stackblitz because the code is on the page!

## Show me the flexbox page!

There are a several blogs out there that explain flex box completely that you may find helpful.   My favorite is [A complete guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).  So, I won't bore you writing about it again.

Instead I wrote a [simple web page](http://davestaud.com) where you can try it out.   As you click on the various options and combination of options, the box will change it's position within the bordered container to the positioning your have selected and in the box.  The CSS that made this happen will be displayed in the box.    Due to the space needed here, it is best if you use your desktop browser.
