I am a passionate software developer with more than 15+ yearsâ€™ experience developing software for small and large companies, such as HBO and across many industries, including Healthcare, Supply Chain Optimization, Investment Banking and Entertainment.  

The technical stack I am currently working in is the MEAN stack (Angular, Node.js/Express and MongoDB), but I also have extensive experience with relational databases and many other languages.
