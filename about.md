I started programming when I was a teenager, back before the Internet and even before most people had PCs in their home. When Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were at each other's throats.  

I loved programming because you could create something real that had never existed before and people could use it!

So, I majored in Computer Science in college and developed code for many years for small companies and large companies, including such names as HBO.  I eventually moved into Software Development in the Airline, Supply-Chain and Healthcare industries.  It was all great fun and I've had a long career, eventually going into management all the way up to VP of Product Development.  

But nothing could ever beat developing code with my own hands!  

And then in 2019, my wife and I made a major change in our lives.  We quit our jobs, sold our home and most of our possessions and began touring the country in an RV!  

Though I had started the re-learning-programming process in 2018, this life change offered the perfect opportunity to put full-time focus on rebooting my development skills.  I focused my attention on a new progressive web app for the RV community called RVLikeMe.com I built on the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) and hosted on AWS.   I haven't had so much fun in years!

That's when I decided I wanted to help others who are new to programming or want to go back, as I did, to get started, and so I created this blog. 

### More Information

I currently work remotely from my RV on freelance or contact development opportunities.
