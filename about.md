I am a passionate software developer and development leader with decades of experience developing and managing development of software for small and large companies across many industries including Healthcare, Supply Chain Optimization, Investment Banking and Entertainment.  

The technical stack I am enjoying right now is the MEAN stack (Angular, Node.js/Express and MongoDB), but I also have extensive experience with relational databases and many other languages.
