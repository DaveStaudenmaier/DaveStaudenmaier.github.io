I started programming when I was a teenager, back before the Internet and even before most people had PCs in their home. When Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were at each other's throats.  

I loved programming because you could take an idea to a something real that real people could use.  I was hooked.

So or course I majored in Computer Science in college, even though that meant dealing with their mainframe computer.  It was all good fun and I've had a long career in software development, eventually going into management all the way up to VP of Product Development.  

But nothing could ever beat developing my own code with my own hands!  

And then in 2019, my wife and I made a major change in our lives.  We quit our jobs, sold our home and most of our possessions and began touring the country in an RV!  Though I had started the re-learning process in 2018, this life change offered the perfect opportunity to focus on rebooting my development skills.  I focused my attention on a new progressive web app for the RV community called RVLikeMe.com.  I built it on the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) and hosted it on AWS.   I haven't had so much fun in years!

That's when I decided I wanted to help others who are new to programming or want to go back, as I did, to get started, and so I created this blog. 

### More Information

I currently work remotely from my RV working freelance or contacts development.
